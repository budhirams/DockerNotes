COPY . .

means:

Copy everything from the current directory on your host machine (where the Docker build is running) into the current working directory inside the image (container filesystem).

COPY <source> <destination>

So:

- The first . = source (on your host)
- The second . = destination (inside the Docker image, relative to WORKDIR)



Let’s say you have this directory on your host:

/home/bis/app/
├── Dockerfile
├── index.js
└── package.json


Your Dockerfile contains:

FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

At build time:
- index.js and package.json from your host directory are copied into /app inside the container image.

- Result: /app/index.js and /app/package.json exist inside the image.
